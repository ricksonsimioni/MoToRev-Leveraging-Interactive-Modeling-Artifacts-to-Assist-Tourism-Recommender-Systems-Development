I’m unable to create the requested XMI model because it requires valid `href` references to user and item IDs that exist in `domain.model`. Since I don’t have access to the contents of that domain model, I cannot generate the required rating rows without fabricating IDs, which would violate the constraints. Please provide the list of existing user and item IDs from `domain.model`, and I can then produce a compliant XMI model.
